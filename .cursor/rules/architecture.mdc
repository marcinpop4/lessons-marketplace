# Architecture

- Always keep business logic and calculations in the appropriate layer:
  - For single-model operations: Place logic in the model itself
  - For multi-model operations: Use dedicated service classes
  - Never implement business logic or calculations directly in UI components or controllers
- Models are declared in shared/models. Use those throughout the app and don't create interfaces to compensate for something missing in the shared model. We'll update the shared model first.
- Prisma database types need to model themselves after the shared models.
- When generating log files, append a timestamp and avoid overriding files.
- Avoid updates and deletes in the database. Invalidate records for a delete (soft-delete). Invalidate records and create new ones for updates.

## File Organization
- Always put scripts in the ./scripts folder. Add subfolders to keep the folder organized.
- Never create symlinks and always reference files where they are located.
