# Enforce Code Deletion

When the user requests to "delete" or "remove" code, ensure the specified lines are completely **deleted** from the file.

**Do not** comment out the code instead of deleting it.

Example:

User request: "Delete the console.log statement on line 10."

**Incorrect Action (Commenting Out):**
```diff
- console.log("Debug message");
+ // console.log("Debug message");
```

**Correct Action (Deleting):**
```diff
- console.log("Debug message");
```

Always prefer complete removal when deletion is requested.
