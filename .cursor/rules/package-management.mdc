# Package Management

- Always maintain package.json in alphabetical order when adding new dependencies.
- This applies to both dependencies and devDependencies sections.
- Pin dependency versions to specific values to ensure reproducible builds.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- Document why specific package versions are required if pinning to older versions.
- Minimize the number of dependencies to reduce security and maintenance risks.
- Use devDependencies for packages only needed during development or building.
