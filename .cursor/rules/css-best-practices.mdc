# CSS Best Practices

- Never use '!important' in CSS rules.
- Structure CSS selectors with appropriate specificity to avoid specificity conflicts.
- Design CSS as a cohesive system where rules work together without overrides.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for CSS classes.
- Group related CSS properties together and order them logically.
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and other repeated values.

## HTML/CSS/JS Structure
- Never use inline CSS (style attributes) or inline JavaScript (onclick attributes).
- Always use separate files for styles and scripts, and use proper event binding in TypeScript files.
- Prefer component-based styling approaches.
