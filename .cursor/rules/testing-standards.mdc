# Testing

- Never increase test timeouts without explicit permission. If tests are timing out, investigate and fix the underlying performance issue rather than extending the timeout.
- Never ever copy code into a test, to test it in isolation. We either make a function more testable or find a way to test it.
- Run tests in docker with --retries=0
- Write tests that are deterministic and don't depend on external state.
- Organize tests with clear arrange-act-assert structure.
- Test for both success and failure conditions.
- Use appropriate mocks for external dependencies.
- Keep test coverage high, especially for critical business logic.
