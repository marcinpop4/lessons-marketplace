# Server Import Conventions

## Shared Module Imports

- When importing modules from the `shared` directory (or using the `@shared` path alias) within any file located in the `server` directory, **always append the `.js` extension** to the import path.
- This is necessary because the TypeScript code in `shared` is compiled to JavaScript, and Node.js ES Modules require the full file path, including the extension, for correct module resolution at runtime.

**Example:**

```typescript
// Correct:
import { SomeModel } from '@shared/models/SomeModel.js';
import { anotherUtil } from '../../shared/utils/anotherUtil.js';

// Incorrect:
import { SomeModel } from '@shared/models/SomeModel';
import { anotherUtil } from '../../shared/utils/anotherUtil';
```
