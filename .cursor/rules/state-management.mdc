# State Management

- Never infer state or status values.
- All status changes must be explicit results of specific events or actions.
- Status transitions should be clearly defined and traceable to specific triggers.
- Use appropriate state management patterns for the complexity of the application.
- Keep state as local as possible, lifting it up only when necessary.
- Document complex state machines with diagrams or clear comments.
- Ensure state changes are predictable and easy to debug.
- Consider using finite state machines for complex state transitions.
- Avoid direct mutation of state; prefer immutable state updates.
