# Frontend Development

- Never create placeholder or sample pages for deployment.
- Always implement the actual functionality to catch real issues early.
- The application should fail fast rather than displaying dummy content that masks underlying problems.
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG guidelines).
- Implement responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.
- Optimize performance for initial load and runtime interactions.
- Handle loading, error, and empty states appropriately.
- Implement proper form validation with clear error messages.
- Use consistent UI patterns throughout the application.
