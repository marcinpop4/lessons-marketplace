# API Design

- Never implement retry logic in API endpoints.
- If an operation fails, return the appropriate error immediately.
- Retry logic should only be implemented at the worker or client level if explicitly requested.
- Use consistent error response formats.
- Document APIs using standardized approaches.
- Implement proper validation for all API inputs.
- Follow RESTful design principles for API endpoints.
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes for different response types.
- Include sufficient information in error responses for debugging without exposing sensitive details.
