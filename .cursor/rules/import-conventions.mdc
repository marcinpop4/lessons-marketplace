# Import Conventions

This document clarifies how to write import statements across different parts of the application (`server/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`, `tests/`) to ensure consistency and compatibility with our tooling (TypeScript compiler, Vite, Jest).

## Guiding Principle: No Aliases, Strict Paths

**Path aliases (e.g., `@/`, `@shared/`) are forbidden in this project.** All imports must use relative paths.

**Import paths in TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`) files generally omit the file extension, EXCEPT for relative imports within directories compiled for Node.js ESM (`server/`, `shared/`), which MUST include the `.js` extension.**

Rely on the respective build/run tools and their configurations (`tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`) for module resolution, but respect Node.js ESM requirements for server-side and shared library relative imports.

## Specific Areas

### 1. Server (`server/**/*`)

-   **Local Imports (within `server/`):** Use relative paths **AND include** the `.js` extension.
    ```typescript
    // Correct:
    import { userService } from './user.service.js';
    import { authMiddleware } from '../auth/auth.middleware.js';
    ```
-   **Shared Imports (from `shared/`):** Use relative paths **AND include** the `.js` extension.
    ```typescript
    // Correct:
    import { Lesson } from '../../shared/models/Lesson.js';
    ```
-   **Reasoning:** Compiled server code runs in Node.js using ESM, which requires explicit `.js` extensions for all relative imports.

### 2. Shared (`shared/**/*.ts`)

-   **Local Imports (within `shared/`):** Use relative paths **AND include** the `.js` extension.
    ```typescript
    // Correct (e.g., inside shared/models/Lesson.ts):
    import { LessonStatus } from './LessonStatus.js';
    import { CurrencyCode } from '../types/Currency.js';

    // Incorrect:
    // import { LessonStatus } from './LessonStatus';
    ```
-   **Node Modules:** Import from `node_modules` as usual (no extension).
    ```typescript
    // Example if needed (though shared should minimize dependencies):
    // import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
    ```
-   **Reasoning:** The `shared` code is compiled and used by the server (Node.js ESM), therefore relative imports within it must adhere to the explicit `.js` extension rule for compatibility.

### 3. Frontend (`frontend/**/*.ts`, `frontend/**/*.tsx`)

-   **Local Imports (within `frontend/`):** Use relative paths **without** the extension.
    ```typescript
    // Correct:
    import { useAuthStore } from './stores/authStore';
    import { LoginButton } from '../components/LoginButton';
    ```
-   **Shared Imports (from `shared/`):** Use relative paths **without** the extension.
    ```typescript
    // Correct:
    import { Lesson } from '../../shared/models/Lesson';
    ```
-   **Node Modules:** Import from `node_modules` as usual (no extension).
    ```typescript
    import React from 'react';
    ```
-   **Reasoning:** Vite handles module resolution for the frontend and does not require extensions for relative paths.

### 4. Tests (`tests/**/*.ts`)

-   **Imports of Source Code (`server/`, `shared/`, `frontend/`):** All imports must use relative paths.
    - Imports *from* `server/` require the `.js` extension.
    - Imports *from* `shared/` require the `.js` extension.
    - Imports *from* `frontend/` must **not** include an extension.
    ```typescript
    // Correct (e.g., from tests/api/some.test.ts):
    import { Lesson } from '../../shared/models/Lesson.js';
    import { someUtil } from './utils/some.util.js'; // if it's a .ts file compiled for tests
    ```
-   **Imports of Test Utilities (within `tests/`):** Use relative paths. Whether to include the extension depends on your Jest/ts-jest configuration, but it's safest to be consistent with the source files you are importing.
    ```typescript
    // Correct (e.g., from within tests/api/lesson.test.ts):
    import { createTestStudent } from './utils/user.utils';
    ```
-   **Node Modules:** Import from `node_modules` as usual (no extension).
    ```typescript
    // Examples:
    import request from 'supertest';
    import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'; 
    import { describe, it, expect, beforeAll } from '@jest/globals'; // Example Jest import
    ```
-   **Reasoning:** Jest (with `ts-jest`) uses `tsconfig.test.json` for module resolution. When importing compiled `.js` files from `server/` or `shared/` via relative paths, the `.js` extension is required by the underlying Node.js ESM runtime.
