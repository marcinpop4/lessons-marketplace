# Environments

- Run ad-hoc commands with NODE_ENV=development|test|production
- In development, a local postgres database running through brew is available. Do not default to the docker database in development.

## Running Scripts
- Run scripts from package.json rather than suggest ad hoc commands.
- There are exceptions, like generic scripts like prisma:create-migration that will be used for several migrations.
- Use consistent naming patterns for scripts in package.json.
- Document complex scripts with comments in the package.json or in a separate document.

## Focus
- Focus on the task at hand.
- For example, when generating a migration, don't install unrelated libraries without asking.
