# Code Maintainability

- Never hardcode values directly in components or functions.
- Extract all magic numbers, URLs, timeouts, and configuration values into named constants or environment variables with clear, descriptive names.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that describe their purpose.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Limit function and file length to improve readability.
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code.
- Maintain consistent formatting and code style throughout the project.
